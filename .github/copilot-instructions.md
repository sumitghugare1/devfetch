# HTTP Client + Server Tool - MERN Stack

This is a MERN stack application that provides:
- A custom HTTP client (like Postman) on the frontend
- A controlled HTTP server with mock endpoints
- Request/response logging and history functionality
- MongoDB integration for data persistence

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for modern UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API server
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose for request logging
- **Features**: Request history, replay functionality, mock endpoints

## Code Style
- Use modern JavaScript/ES6+ features
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep components modular and reusable
